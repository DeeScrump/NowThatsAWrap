# NowThatsAWrap

## Task

With our team, We work with our group to build a performant and scalable MERN stack single-page application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand. In creating our collaborative application, we combine a scalable MongoDB back end and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. We continue to build on the agile development methodologies we’ve used throughout this course, like storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
