# NOW THAT'S A WRAP
## Project Description 

Haiven Kornbluth is the culinary genius behind the movement of Now That’s A Wrap. He is a visionary that has traveled the globe and explored diverse dynamics with the culinary world. With a vigorous six years in the restaurant industry, he knew that his style, technique and vision was too untamed for a typical restaurant Although he pays homage to every skill and lesson developed by his mentors, he knew it was time to venture off on his own in 2016. He took a simple concept of a healthy wrap and added the “Haiven” flavor to each bite. His business, Now That’s A Wrap, became a product worth buzzing about. While building his business from the ground, he was able to complete his culinary education at the elite Auguste Escoffier Culinary Arts school, earning his Culinary Arts Diploma in 2018 and earned an Associates of Science Degree in Culinary Arts in 2020.

## User Story
As a person interested in eating out and various restaurants
I want to be able to get up-to-date information regarding a specific restaurant via their online website 

So that I can have clear expectations of their current location, menu items, special events and VIP offers if any

When you view a standard restaurant page, you find the information and menu times, but very little information regarding people’s thoughts about the location and/or menu items.  What if you were able to make comments, add reviews about each menu item for your favorite restaurants.
## Acceptance Criteria
